# Exploring NoSQL Databases

As a part of CS 157C at SJSU, I studied and experimented with various NoSQL databases:
- Cassandra
- Redis
- MongoDB
- Neo4j

Term project - [Travel Recommendation Application with Cassandra](https://github.com/nair-ayush/CS157C-Team4)

## Mini projects
I also created multiple mini-projects for each of them, using Java and Python, trying to solve real world problems or replicating applications in the real world.
- [Neo4j - Replicating Facebook](https://github.com/chinhegde/Exploring-Neo4j)
- [MongoDB - Online Bookstore](https://github.com/chinhegde/Online-Bookstore-with-MongoDB)
- [Jedis - Car dealership](https://github.com/chinhegde/Exploring-Jedis)
- [Redis - Car dealership (Command line experimentation)](https://github.com/chinhegde/Exploring-Redis)
